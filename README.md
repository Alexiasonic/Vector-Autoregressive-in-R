# Vector-Autoregressive-in-R


The script replicates the example in Kilian and Lutkepohl (2017), Structural Vector Autoregressive
Analysis, Cambridge University Press, Chapter 9 (page 239-240).

The exercise focuses on the identification of an oil price shock and its impact on inflation and 
real GDP. 

The oil price shock is identified by using a recursive scheme (that is through Cholesky
decomposition of the VAR's reduced form residuals covariance matrix).

These R codes allow to compute impulse response functions (IRFs), Forecast Error Variance 
Decomposition (FEVD) and Historical Decomposition (HD).
